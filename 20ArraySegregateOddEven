//Here we need to segregate all evens and odds in an array order doesn't matter.
/*- We'll take 2 variable, i & j
- i = 0 & j = arr.length - 1
- Now we'll start from i & keep on increasing i as far as it's even value as our target is to place even values at first
- Similarly, we'll start from j & keep on decreasing j as far as it's odd value as our target is to place odd values in second part
- Now we swap values 
- We do until i is lesser than j*/
